I quickly ran out and, a few streets away, joined a large crowd of people. We could see the fire only from a distance because the police would not allow any one near the building on fire. What a terrible scene I saw that day! Huge flames of fire were coming out of each floor, and black and thick smoke spread all around. Four fire engines were engaged and the firemen in their uniform were playing the hose on various parts of the building. Then the tall ladders of the fire engine were stretched upwards. Some firemen climbed up with hoses in their hands. The continuous flooding brought the fire under control but the building was completely destroyed.",

Men, women and children were moving from corner to corner, admiring the beauty of all kinds of stalls set up. These stalls were like small shops.
